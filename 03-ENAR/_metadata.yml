  When wires are cut, the tool produces striations on the
  cut surface; as in other forms of forensic analysis,
  these striation marks are used to connect the evidence
  to the source that created them. The practice of comparing
  two wire cut surfaces introduces complexities not present
  in better-investigated forensic examination of toolmarks
  such as those observed on bullets, as wire comparisons
  inherently require multiple distinct comparisons,
  increasing the error rate. We call attention to this
  multiple comparison problem in wire examination,
  and relate it to other situations in forensics that
  involve multiple comparisons, such as database searches.
